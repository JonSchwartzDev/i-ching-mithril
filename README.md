# i-ching-mithril
This is an example of how small a great-looking responsive single page app can be, using mithril.js. 
The content is the 3500-year-old taoist text, the I Ching, which offers nicely structured data, coolly 
binary logic from oh so long ago, and the opportunity for very nice-looking images that are small in 
size. 

The web app works well on phones, tablets and PC browser, with great, snappy interactions because the 
data is all local in the SPA. *Total* size in less than 250kb: 119kb of images, 46 kb of mithril.js library 
(a less-known but smaller, faster alternative to Angular or React or Vue), and 50kb of JS and CSS (which 
is mainly the data for the book).

It's hosted and running at http://iching.blackoak.io

It's on my list to make the exact same app with Angular and React and Vue as a way to compare the 
libraries - particularly the minimum required JS to implement a good SPA with each library.
